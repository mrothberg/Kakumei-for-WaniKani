- Created WaniKaniAPIV1Interface
    - All classes that use the WaniKani api were modified go through this interface 
        (previously the interaction was through static calls)
    - There are 2 implementation of this interface (for V1 and V2 API)
    - This allows MainActivity to choose which class to new up,
        which allowed fast switching between implementations to verify V2 implementation worked correctly
    
- Created 'apimodels' package for V2 API objects and renamed old package 'wkamodels'
    - apimodels package are objects that wanikani v2 responses get deserialized into
    - WaniKaniApiV2 creates wkamodel classes using new API so the rest of the application will work the same as before
    - This allowed minimum change to exising code, as the same data types are being returned

- Removed fields from ProfileFragment that don't exist in V2 API

- Changed directory structure to allow for UT/IT packages

- Fix Vocabulary items missing data in ItemDetailsActivity - BaseItem was only retrieving certain data for Kanji items

- Unregister sync receivers in onDestroyView() for the fragments that the DashboardFragment creates

- Use https://github.com/Codewaves/Sticky-Header-Grid to create Radical/Kanji/Vocabulary due to deprecation of https://github.com/TonicArtos/StickyGridHeaders
