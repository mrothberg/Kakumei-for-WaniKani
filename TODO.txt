High Priority
- Notifications support
- Lessons issues - Blank screen due to wk script crashes
                 - Character sometimes doesn't update when you proceed to a 2nd set of lessons
- Javadoc/better documentation
- Investigate WaniKani API error cases (no internet, etc)
- Use Github Issues/Milestones to track bugs and features
- Firebase stuff - Crashlytics done, monitor for crashes. Potentially add more custom logging
- Clean up gradle scripts (check dependency versions to ensure latest)
- Support correct back button navigation between main fragments (dashboard, radicals, kanji, vocab...) & add quit confirmation
- ProgressCard issues - card sometimes doesn't display properly

Medium Priority
- Dark mode
- Radical/Kanji/Vocab Adapters have a bunch of shared code - should be refactored somehow
- Radical/Kanji/Vocab item RecyclerView fast scrolling
- Radical/Kanji/Vocab item RecyclerView hover over/long press highlighting
- Radicals, Kanji, and Vocabulary fragments prob have a limit on the number of items that will be displayed
    - Currently no pagination handling if too many items are returned from the api
- Better logging of api request calls - especially failure cases
- Existing bug - sometimes the LevelPicker will also select the user's level + 1
- Reduce number of API requests made When navigating from the Dashboard to the ProgressDetailsActivity (by clicking progress card)
- Better caching of user - we make too many api calls to get the user's current level (maybe attach user obj to sync intent)
- Vacation Mode support

Low Priority
- Rename android studio project to Kakumei
- Google autoformat style/spacing
- Rate limit requests
- Caching of subjects - using updatedAfter queries to only get new data
- Recent Unlocks and Critical Items Views
- Java date objects instead of Strings in api models?
- BaseItem methods - getKana() getOnyomi() getKunyomi() can prob be refactored
- Subscription support - should only show users subject data up to their subbed level

Other Ideas
- Timber for logging

Plug in Ideas
