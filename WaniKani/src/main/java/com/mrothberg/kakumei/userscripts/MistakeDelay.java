 *  ====  Wanikani Mistake Delay  ====
 *    ==     by Rui Pinheiro      ==
 *
 *  After the new client-side review system was introduced, reviews became blazing fast.
 *
 *  The downside of that speed was that I found myself pressing 'Enter' twice after answering
 *  any question I'm sure is correct, but then finding out it isn't, yet the second 'Enter' press
 *  already took effect and it skips automatically to the following item.
 *
 *  This script takes care of that problem, blocking 'Enter' presses for 1 second if a mistake is
 *  made. This makes 'Enter' spamming work only if the answer was correct, and if not will
 *  "force" you to take notice.
 *
 *
 *  Note that this script does not change the behaviour of the "Next" button.
 *
 *
 *  DISCLAIMER:
 *  I am not responsible for any problems caused by this script.
 *  This script was developed on Firefox 22.0 with Greasemonkey 1.10.
 *  Because I'm just one person, I can't guarantee the script works anywhere else.
 *  Though, it should also work on Chrome with Tampermonkey
